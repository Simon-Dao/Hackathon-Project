Hello, my name is Simon Dao and I have spent the last 16 hours programming this(no joke). 

I want to apologize for writing the worst code you will 
ever have the unfortune of laying your eyes upon. Frankly, I had good intentions for the my code at first. I even tried to write it as clean as possible.
But time has forced my hand and I had no choice but to write this god forsaken spaghetti abomination of a program. I am very sorry you had to read through this code.

It is currently 4:05 AM in the morning and I think I am going to go sleep now. 

Good night
